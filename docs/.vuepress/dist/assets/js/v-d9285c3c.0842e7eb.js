Versions of Redmi devices differ in LTE band support, pre-installed ROM and packaging, while the versions of Mi phones tend to be identical in hardware and only come in a different box and with a different ROM. Some Xiaomi devices only have Chinese versions while Android One models aren&#39;t sold in Mainland China at all.</p><h3 id="chinese-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chinese-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chinese Version</h3><p>Chinese versions are manufactured and sold in Mainland China, they come in a Chinese box with a NEMA plug power adapter and the China Stable ROM pre-installed. Most resellers sell the Chinese versions of Xiaomi devices with a Global ROM (often labelled as &quot;International version&quot; or &quot;Global ROM version&quot;), since some devices are only available in China.</p><div class="custom-container warning"><p class="custom-container-title">WARNING</p><p>On Chinese Versions manufactured after May 2018, it&#39;s not possible to boot any ROM other than the official Chinese one if the bootloader is locked.</p></div><h3 id="global-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#global-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Global Version</h3><p>Global versions are manufactured in Mainland China and sold in the rest of the market (outside of Mainland China and India). The box&#39;s language and the power adapter&#39;s plug varies by region, but the phone always comes with the Global Stable ROM or one of its variants pre-installed. Global Redmi devices also support more LTE bands than their Chinese counterparts. Global versions usually have a red &#39;Global Version&#39; sticker on the box and it&#39;s worth noting that most resellers offer both the Global and Chinese versions of devices.</p><h3 id="indian-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#indian-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Indian Version</h3><p>Indian versions are manufactured and sold in India, they come in an English box with an Indian power adapter and the India Stable ROM pre-installed. Indian Redmi devices support significantly less LTE bands than Chinese ones, because only a fraction of those bands are used in India. Resellers who are dealing with Indian versions are extremely hard to come by so you shouldn&#39;t worry about encountering them. Indian versions have a red &#39;Made in India&#39; sticker on the box.</p>',9),r={render:function(e,i){const n=(0,a.up)("RouterLink");return(0,a.wg)(),(0,a.j4)(a.HY,null,[(0,a.Wm)("p",null,[(0,a.Wm)(n,{to:"/"},{default:(0,a.w5)((()=>[o])),_:1})]),s],64)}}}}]);
